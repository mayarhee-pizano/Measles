		<p>Our clinic will be efficient and cheap so that low income communitites have access and are able to afford vaccinations. Our clinic will also be advertised so that the people who need vaccinations are aware of this cheap and reliable clinic. Also, our clinic won't require any form of medical insurance to get vaccinated due to the number of people who don't have it in low income communities. However, if a customer does have insurance, they will be able to use it.</p>
